## Challenge

Our client is young nonprofit organization that aims to build a vibrant, equitable music scene in Boston. They know that Boston-based artists need support overcoming barriers to make music. In this strategic planning process, our client wanted find out what artists’ needs are and which gaps our client as a nonprofit in the music industry is best positioned to fill.
 
## Process

###  Interviews with External Stakeholders

> To learn more about artists’ needs, the Boston music scene, the music industry writ large, and the role non-profits can play, we interviewed:
- artists
- music industry professionals
- peer organizations in Boston
- benchmark organizations outside of Boston

My team put together a presentation of the interview findings for our client’s Strategic Planning Committee and some of the illustrations I created to facilitate discussion are below.

**Strengths and weaknesses of the Boston music scene**

**Iterating hypothesis on artist progression**

> Our initial hypothesis was that artists at different stages have different needs, and that artist progression is a funnel-shaped process – not everyone can move on to the next stage. The original goal was to identify artists who have the ability to progress professionally and support them in becoming self-sustaining artists who have a career in music.

In interviews, we found that artists pursued music in a variety of ways – a former full-time artist found more creative freedom and flexibility in pursuing music half-time after she had a child, another full-time artist created her own membership model for fans, and yet another artist had a full-time job unrelated to music because he felt *“[you’re] less apt to corrupt what you do if you don’t intend to make a living from it.”*

**Key insight #1:** While artist progression is a funnel-shaped process, there is flexibility in how artists can incorporate music in their lives, and this can change over time for an individual. There are other equally valid ways to engage in and contribute to the music community besides being a full-time artist.

**Key insight #2:** All artists have financial, space, development, and community needs. These needs may vary depending on whether artists are *emerging* artists who are just starting out, *“flex artists”* who pursue music but do not rely on it for their income, and *“career artists”* who aim to make a career from their original works.

## Artist Survey
I designed a ten-minute artist survey that consisted of both closed and open-ended questions. The goal was to learn about artists’ goals and barriers, so we can inform how our client can serve artists better and shape a collective vision about what Boston music could be.

**Artist Goals & Barriers**
> Our initial hypothesis was that making a living from music was a marker of success for artists. However, survey results and qualitative interview responses showed that this was not artists’ top priority.

 *“People are going to make music whether it’s funded or not, but I would be able to give 10 times more [to my music] if given the resources.”*

*“Every show has to be better than the last.”*

**Key insight #3:** While affordability is the primary barrier for most artists, making an income from music is not a primary goal for most artists. The primary goal is growth and progression as an artist.

**Key instight #4:** Black artists, hip hop artists, and female artists have similar goals as the rest of the artists, but face significant barriers to accessing opportunities to perform and connecting to the music community.

## Design Principles 
> These design principes mirror the organization's language and values.
- **Our house is your house.**
As a non-profit, this organization belongs to everyone. It’s a legal reality and a cultural imperative.
- **Popular music is art.**
Popular music is a legitimate artform through which artists contribute to human creative expression. 
- **Artists are workers.**
Artists’ labor should be fairly compensated.
- **You made it, you own it.**
Intellectual property should be owned by its creators. 
- **Creativity for all.**
All people should have access to making music, regardless of gender, race, class, sexuality, or status. 
- **Artists make cities better.** 
Artists build bridges between communities, drive creative economies, and make their cities a more desirable place to live and work.
- **Real functioning economy.**
This organizations operates as an entrepreneurial nonprofit within a largely commercial music industry, and invests philanthropic capital to make the industry function better. 
- **No heroes, no assholes.**
A collaborative music community thrives only in an environment of mutual trust and respect. 


## Prototyping and Testing
Given what artists' vision of what Boston's music scene could be and artists' goals and barriers, my team created a logic model for the organization.

### Logic Model
<img src="assets/images/logicmodel.png" style="width: 800px;"/>

We facilitated a discussion of research findings and tested program ideas with a diverse group of the organization's stakeholders, including board members, Boston artists of color, hip hop artists, female artists, queer artists, music tech leaders, music fans, and venue owners.

### Testing Program Mix

<br> *Bolded programs are already in place.*

The working prototype of the program mix consists of:
1. **affordable recording and rehearsal space** for all artists  
2. an **artist accelerator program** to provide targed support for career artists
