the best kind is unexpected —  
silver slope of a shoulder beginning  
to curve into back  
inside of wrists, soft but shaking like earth  
backs of knees  
ankles  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *stop looking* —  
the worst kind is slow. Deliberate.  
Still it’s curious how  
the body folds onto itself, how  
people fold into other people we  
are origami corners sharp  
creases bold yet  
torn where we changed our minds  
That’s not beautiful or handsome just  
paper thin.
