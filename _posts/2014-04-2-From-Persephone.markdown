I know the best mornings are made of  
pancake batter, warm skin, loose stockings  
how to count tree rings,  
even though they don’t really matter  
the precise moment to  
bite into a persimmon  
how to catch them  
before they splatter onto the ground  
that the red in my bottom lip is proof  
I shouldn’t have, but  
I swallowed the pomegranate seed  
anyway.  
When I came home for the holidays  
I didn’t tell my mother a tree started  
growing inside of me        without her  
my roots have sunken  
into things  
darker  
than soil,  
deeper  
than earth and  
I’ve started to hunger for  
things other than harvest  
but in postcards to her  
from places like  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;empty apartments  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the edges of the ocean,  

 I write:  
“Doing fine. Miss you.” in the language of the dead.  
I never pick  
the prettiest flower anymore  
pluck it right out of the ground  
That is something  
girls do. Girls who do not know  
how easy it is  
for the ground to break open  
how fathers will stand by  
in old college sweatshirts and watch  
the difference between sinking  
and drowning  
is the acceptance of fate  
sometimes  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I dip myself in the river  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to forget.  

All the hours are violet here.
