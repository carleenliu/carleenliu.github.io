Dear Carleen,  

Two years ago, we both acknowledged that we don't particularly care for this corporate scheme to sell flowers, pastries, and cards. Still, I don't mind using every excuse I can to tell you how much you mean to me.

One year ago, I said "I love you." I had it bad (still do!). Don't know a single person who's simultaneously as capable, wise, kind, loving, funny, and beautiful.

This year, I'm more than 10,000 kilometers away from you (the metric system is actually really growing on me). I miss you so much but there's nobody I'd rather be doing this with. I'm 89 plus 11 percent sure of that. 

My kids are smart and they told me to definitely get you something. You're an amazing writer (I *love* reading everything you write) so I really want to give you a place to put down your thoughts. I suppose this isn't the most practical solution but I hope you don't mind learning a bit about code with my help.

With deep love and respect,  
Jonathan
