		<p>PuppyTime is a mobile website that enables folks to live video chat with shelter dogs and give them treats. This gives the dog more social time and builds a personal connection between the user and the dog to increase donations and adoption.</p>
		<p>This project was created with my team at SheHacks Boston 2018. We won Most Entrepreneurial Hack sponsored by Rough Draft Ventures and Best Use of Amazon Web Services (AWS) sponsored by Major League Hacking. I helped structure our ideation session and did some pair programming on page styling. I will be conducting user testing in the coming months to refine our product. Check out more on our devpost here.

			<h2>Cognitive Research: Group Effects in Cooperation and Punishment</h2>
		</header>
<p>Social categories, or groups, play a large role in decision making. Ingroup bias strongly
influences cooperative decision-making as people tend to share more with ingroup members and
differentially enforce fairness norms depending on the group membership of their interaction
partners (McAuliffe and Dunham, 2016). We tend to like ingroup members, and also expect
more from ingroup members. These two features of ingroup bias in cooperation tend to
complement each other until punishment comes into the picture. </p>

<p> Are we more likely to punish ingroup members or outgroup members for not cooperating with us? Read more about how over 500 players from different political groups behaved in my modified Ultimatum game. </p>
