I graduated with a BS in Cognitive Science from Yale University in 2016. I love data and love words, and believe they have the power to shape people's experiences in my communities and beyond. 

Currently reading: <i>Sprint: How to Solve Big Problems and Test New Ideas in Just Five Days</i> by Jake Knapp, John Zeratsky, Braden Kowitz, Dan Bittner
