					<h3>Vitality of Catholic parishes</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Catholic populations are aging, and many parishes across the nation are struggling to fill their pews. A regional Catholic diocese created a Task Force to study the spiritual, physical, and fiscal health of each parish to make recommendations to the Bishop that would ensure the viability of the diocese and vibrancy of Catholic life in the Church. My team was tasked with assessing the health of each parish and designing a comparative database tool to inform the Task Force’s decision making.</p>
