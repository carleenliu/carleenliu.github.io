<p>NurseBadge is a wearable that updates nurses with important patient events since their last shift, notifies them appropriately according to severity of the alarm, and facilitates communication with other nurses.</p>

<p>This project was created with my team at Computer Measurement Group's NeedforSpeed health hackathon. We won Best UX Pitch and Best Solution for Population and Patient Engagement. I came up with the idea, facilitated our ideation session, conducted a user interview over the phone with a nursing home nurse, partnered with our UI designer to create low fidelity wireframes, made the presentation and pitched our project.</p>
