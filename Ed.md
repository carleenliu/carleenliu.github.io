## Challenge

In the United States, 20 million women and 10 million men suffer from an eating disorder at some time in their life. Our client is an eating disorders organization that wants to better serve all people affected by eating disorders and be a proactive leader in the field. My team was tasked with designing programmatic and organizational strategy for our client’s next five years.  

## Process

### Interviews with Eating Disorder Professionals
> To evaluate the current state of the eating disorders field, we interviewed:
- Clinicians
- Researchers
- Leaders of local ED organizations
- Advocates


Eating disorders are:

**Key finding #1**: There is a lack of centralized data, resources, and leadership in the eating disorders world.

### Survey 
> To better understand the needs of our client's constituents, we surveyed individuals, families & professionals about:
- Current programs 
- National conference
- Local engagement
- Demographics
- Access to treatment

**Key finding #2**: While our client has been successful in reaching some demographics, it can expand its reach across age, race, gender, and socioeconomic status.

## Design Principles
1.	Make services accessible to all people affected by eating disorders across the US<br>
    - *Design services for and expand reach to underserved populations*
2.	Catalyze and disseminate impactful research on prevention and treatment

## Prototyping and Testing

### Financial Model 
We tested the financial impact of different scenarios in local engagement, partnerships, conference structure, and research funding.

## Outcomes
*In progress… to come!*
